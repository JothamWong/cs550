# Advice for Presentation of Student Projects

## Presentation content and length

The allowed time for presentation is 15 minutes (excluding questions). If you speak more than that, we reserve the right to stop you and grade you based on whatever you managed to say in those 15 minutes.

Your presentation should summarize your project. In particular, we'd expect you to spend 5 minutes on:

  * introduce yourself (everyone should speak!)
  * state the goals of the project
  * indicate which theoretical background you neededed
  * mention the title of your background paper
  * indicate what makes your project non-trivial

In the remaining ~10 minutes you should:

  * state the work you have done (main part)
  * indicate what remains to be done
  * summarize what you did


## Presentation style 

Here are some useful resources on how to prepare and give talks:

  * [How To Speak by Patrick Winston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)
  * [How to give a great research talk by Simon Peyton Jones](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/give-great-research-talk/)

Please incorporate as many points of the talk of Patrick Winston as you believe apply to your presentation. It is an amazing and entertaining talk, despite (or because) it is meta-circular: he does as he says. (Note: breaking physical objects or referring to supernatural beings in your video is not required.) Use your own judgement: strike a balance in 
  * being comfortable with _what_ and _how_ you say content
  * trying out these pieces of advice
